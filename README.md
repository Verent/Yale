# Yale (.NET Standard 2.0)

Yale is yet another expression parser and evaluator library for .Net

Like other expression frameworks Yale evaluates string expressions like `sqrt(a^2 + b^2)` and  `name() = "Maria"` at runtime. In Yale, these expressions are compiled to the [Common Intermediate Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language). This results in a blazing fast performance of expression evaluation after compilation. The primary design objective of Yale is to make it as intuitive and easy to use as possible.

Yale is based on [Flee](https://github.com/mparlak/Flee) (Fast Lightweight Expression Evaluator) with the intent to modernize and simplify the source code and usage.

## What is the state of Yale?
Yale is stabalizing. Yale is feature complete for the current major release, all work now is focused on stabilizing, performance improvements, better test coverage and bug-fixes. Any bugs reported will be prioritized and feedback would be appreciated.
